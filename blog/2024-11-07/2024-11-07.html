	<p>
        Two weeks ago, I quit social media. After taking a hard look at <i>why</i> I was using it, I decided that the tradeoffs of doing so just weren't worth it. I have broader thoughts on that whole matter, but those are for another day. What's important to know for now is that I logged out of my accounts, uninstalled their respective apps from my phone, and called it a day.
	</p>
	<p>
		That is, right up until politics got in the way.
	</p>
	<p>
		This week has been a mess online, to say the least. I feel neither obligated to cover every ounce of discourse so far nor confident in my ability to even do so. Suffice it to say that I've seen enough in my brief relapses of Reddit use to feel all the more comfortable with my decision to go dark.
	</p>
	<p>
		That being said, I've taken a certain (perhaps morbid) interest in the collective reaction to Tuesday's results. If statistics are to be believed, the proportion of dread felt by some Americans is remarkably close to the joy felt by others. In either case, that raw emotion has manifested in a diverse array of ways. Joy has rendered hope, gratitude, and arrogance in much the same manner that dread has rendered grief, guilt, and resilience.
	</p>
	<p>
		There is, though, a third pillar to the above that has caught my attention. That, I feel, is best demonstrated by XKCD number 3008: Proterozoic Rocks.
		<div style="width:100%;text-align:center;"><a href="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/proterozoic_rocks.png"><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/proterozoic_rocks.png" width="50%" align="middle"></a></div>
	</p>
	<p>
		For the uninitiated, XKCD is the brainchild of Randall Munroe, who advocated for the Harris campaign in the banner of XKCD's site. While I hesitate to put words in Munroe's mouth, it is not inconceivable to think that his feelings have trended towards the negative through the latter half of this week.
	</p>
	<p>
		Yet despite the relationship between Tuesday's results and Munroe's politics, Munroe's work in Proterozoic Rocks has provided me with a first glimpse of what art may look like under the incoming administration. If the current consensus is to be believed, the next few years will prove consequential for Americans, the world, or both. The conversation surrounding these years is guaranteed to be volatile at best, and engagement-driven algorithms are all but mandated to provide kerosene to such a flame. If a word exists to describe forming one's opinion only in a sea of others', now is its time to shine.
	</p>
	<p>
		Where I applaud Munroe is in his effort to present the opposite: an intimate, introspective view into how he copes that foregoes discourse. To me, the comic is a quiet "I see you" that offers empathy in a time that lacks it. There's also a certain degree of solace to it as well, both figuratively and literally on account of the illustrations. Ultimately, what is thus produced is art for the sake of feeling <i>collectively</i> just so that we might feel a little less alone.
	</p>
	<p>
		...or he just really likes the rocks.
